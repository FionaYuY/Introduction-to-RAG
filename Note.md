# Key Terms
- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG): A technique in AI where a LLM accesses new or recent data outside its training set to provide better answers and improved results.
- Vector database: A search engine or database that stores vectorized documents, enabling more accurate information retrieval for AI models.
- Embeddings: Representations of text data as vectors in a high-dimensional space, allowing similarity comparisons between different pieces of text.
- Azure AI Search: Microsoft's cloud-based search service that offers retrieval augmentation capabilities for LLMs.
- Comma separated value (CSV)
- Pandas library
- Qdrant: Software used for creating an in-memory vector database search, enabling efficient text retrieval and embedding storage.
- Sentence transformers: A tool to encode sentences into numerical representations (embeddings) that can be compared using cosine similarity or other distance metrics.
- Cosinge distance: A measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors in a multi-dimensional space, often used in text analysis and information retrieval.

# Mangage Data for embeddings
- import the data into panda df
- transform the df into dict ```df.to_dict('records')```
